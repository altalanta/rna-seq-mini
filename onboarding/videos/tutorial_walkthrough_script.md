## [0:00 - 1:00] Introduction

[SCREEN: Welcome screen with platform logo]

**Narrator (warm, encouraging voice):**
"Welcome to the NHANES BMI Body Fat Analysis Platform! In this 15-minute tutorial, you'll learn everything you need to conduct sophisticated epidemiological research - even if you've never used R before."

[SHOW: Quick overview of what we'll cover]
"By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Set up your research environment
- Configure analysis parameters
- Run a complete BMI analysis
- Interpret and export results"

**Narrator:**
"Let's get started! Don't worry if you're new to this - we'll take it step by step."

## [1:00 - 3:00] Step 1: Environment Setup

[SCREEN: Terminal and RStudio interface]

**Narrator:**
"First, let's set up your environment. Open your terminal and navigate to where you want to work."

[CUT TO: Terminal commands]
```bash
git clone https://github.com/altalanta/nhanes-bmi-bodyfat.git
cd nhanes-bmi-bodyfat
```

**Narrator:**
"Now let's check if everything is ready. Type this command:"

[CUT TO: make health-check command]
```bash
make health-check
```

[SHOW: Expected output]
```
âœ… PIPELINE HEALTH CHECK: All systems operational!
ðŸš€ Ready to run analysis with: make parallel-pipeline
ðŸ“š Get started with: make tutorial
```

**Narrator:**
"Perfect! Your system is ready. Now let's launch the interactive tutorial."

## [3:00 - 6:00] Step 2: Interactive Tutorial

[SCREEN: Tutorial interface launch]

**Narrator:**
"Launch the tutorial with this simple command:"

```bash
make tutorial
```

[SCREEN: Tutorial interface with progress tracking]

**Narrator:**
"The tutorial opens in your web browser. You can see your progress at the top, and each section builds on the previous one."

[CUT TO: Walking through first section]
"Let's start with the NHANES data overview. This section explains what NHANES is and why it's important for research."

[SHOW: Interactive elements - clicking through sections, answering quiz questions]

**Narrator:**
"See how easy it is? The tutorial includes quizzes to test your understanding. Just click on your answer and get immediate feedback."

[SHOW: Progress bar advancing]
"Notice how your progress bar advances as you complete each section. You can always come back later if you need to take a break."

## [6:00 - 9:00] Step 3: Configuration Wizard

[SCREEN: Configuration wizard interface]

**Narrator:**
"Now let's configure our analysis. Instead of editing complex configuration files, we'll use the visual configuration wizard."

[CUT TO: Launching config wizard]
```bash
make config-wizard
```

[SCREEN: Configuration interface with sliders and dropdowns]

**Narrator:**
"This web interface lets you customize your analysis without any programming knowledge. Let's set our age range."

[SHOW: Adjusting age range slider]
"Simply drag the slider to set the minimum and maximum ages for your study. The default is 20-59 years, which focuses on working-age adults."

[SHOW: Other configuration options]
"You can also adjust survey design parameters, output directories, and logging levels - all with helpful explanations."

**Narrator:**
"When you're happy with your settings, click 'Save Configuration' and then 'Run Analysis'."

## [9:00 - 12:00] Step 4: Running the Analysis

[SCREEN: Analysis execution]

**Narrator:**
"Let's run our first analysis! Use this command:"

```bash
make parallel-pipeline
```

[SHOW: Real-time progress output]
"Watch as the system automatically:
1. Downloads NHANES data files
2. Validates data integrity
3. Sets up survey design
4. Runs parallel statistical analysis
5. Generates visualizations
6. Creates your final report"

**Narrator:**
"The parallel processing uses all your CPU cores, making it 3-5x faster than traditional analysis. You can see the progress in real-time."

[SHOW: Completion message]
"When it's done, you'll see a summary of what was created."

## [12:00 - 14:00] Step 5: Exploring Results

[SCREEN: Results directory structure]

**Narrator:**
"Let's explore what the analysis created. Navigate to the outputs directory."

[CUT TO: File browser showing outputs/]
"You'll find:
- Tables: Statistical results in CSV format
- Figures: Publication-ready visualizations
- Report: Complete HTML documentation
- Logs: Detailed analysis information"

[SHOW: Opening correlation results]
"Let's look at the correlation results first. This CSV file contains the main statistical findings."

[SHOW: Opening HTML report]
"The HTML report provides a complete summary with interactive visualizations and detailed methodology."

**Narrator:**
"You can now use these results in your research papers, presentations, or further analysis."

## [14:00 - 15:00] Next Steps and Advanced Features

[SCREEN: Advanced features overview]

**Narrator:**
"Congratulations! You've successfully completed your first NHANES BMI analysis."

[SHOW: Quick overview of advanced features]
"For your next analysis, you might want to explore:
- Custom statistical models
- Integration with other datasets
- Advanced visualization options
- API access for automation"

**Narrator:**
"Remember, you can always:
