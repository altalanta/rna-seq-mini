Automated result interpretation, pathway impact analysis, gene network discovery, and biomarker identification with multi-audience explanations. See [Advanced Features](docs/advanced.md) for usage details.

## 🔧 Error Handling & Troubleshooting

Comprehensive error classification, automatic recovery, and diagnostic tools help resolve issues quickly. Use `make troubleshoot` for specific errors and `make diagnostics` for system health checks.

## ⚡ Resource Optimization

Intelligent resource allocation and cloud auto-scaling help optimize performance and costs. Use `make estimate-resources` to analyze your dataset and `make cloud-autoscale` for AWS deployments.

## 🔬 Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis

Comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq analysis supporting 10x Genomics, Drop-seq, Smart-seq, and spatial transcriptomics. Use `make run-singlecell` for dedicated analysis or include in main pipeline.

**Supported Technologies:** 10x Genomics, Drop-seq, Smart-seq, spatial transcriptomics
**Quantification:** CellRanger, Kallisto|bustools, STARsolo, Alevin-fry
**Analysis:** QC, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, annotation

## 📊 Outputs & Results

Analysis generates comprehensive reports including:
- **MultiQC quality reports** with interactive dashboards
- **Differential expression tables** and volcano plots
- **Pathway enrichment results** with visualization
- **Interactive web dashboard** for result exploration
